2023,Effects of coenzyme Q10 and N-acetylcysteine on experimental poisoning by paracetamol in Wistar rats.,"Paracetamol (PAR) is a drug widely used in human and veterinary medicine as an analgesic and antipyretic, often involved in cases of intoxication. The most common clinical signs result from damage to red blood cells and hepatocytes, and this intoxication is considered a model for the induction of acute liver failure. In the present study, the hepatoprotective effects of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) against experimental paracetamol (PAR) poisoning were analysed. Thirty-five adult Wistar rats (Rattus novergicus albinus) were randomly assigned to five groups, and thirty-one of these survived the treatments. Negative control group (CON-) received 1mL of 0.9% NaCl orally (PO). Other groups received 1.2g/kg of PAR (PO). Positive control group (CON+) received only PAR. NAC group received 800 mg/kg intraperitoneally (IP) of NAC 1h after the administration of PAR and at 12 h received 1mL of 0.9% NaCl, IP. The fourth group (CoQ10) received 1h and 12 h after intoxication, CoQ10 (10mg/kg IP). And the fifth group (NAC+CoQ10) received NAC (800mg/kg, IP) and CoQ10 (10mg/kg, IP). After 12 hours, the rats were euthanized and necropsied to collect liver and kidney tissues for histopathological evaluation and electronic microscopy. A single dose of PAR caused severe acute hepatitis. NAC couldn't reverse the liver and kidney damages. The group that received CoQ10 and NAC had moderate liver damage, while the group that received only CoQ10 had lower values of liver enzymes and mild liver and kidney damage. Animals that received treatment with CoQ10 or NAC+CoQ10 presented normal hepatocyte mitochondria and nuclei. Although CoQ10 couldn't reverse PAR organ damage, results indicate promising hepatoprotection in Wistar rats.",01-01-2023,17-08-2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2023/
2023,Changes in hospital consumption of opioid and non-opioid analgesics after colorectal endometriosis surgery.,"The aim of this study was to analyze postoperative consumption of analgesics during hospitalization following colorectal surgery for endometriosis. We conducted a retrospective study at Tenon University Hospital, Paris, France from February 2019 to December 2021. One hundred sixty-two patients underwent colorectal surgery: eighty-nine (55%) by robotic and seventy-three (45%) by conventional laparoscopy. The type of procedure had an impact on acetaminophen and nefopam consumed per day: consumption for colorectal shaving, discoid resection, and segmental resection was, respectively, 2(0.5), 2.1(0.6), 2.4(0.6) g/day (p = 10-3), and 25(7), 30(14), 31(11) mg/day (p = 0.03). The total amount of tramadol consumed was greater following robotic surgery compared with conventional laparoscopy (322(222) mg vs 242(292) mg, p = 0.04). We observed a switch in analgesic consumption over the years: tramadol was used by 70% of patients in 2019 but only by 7.1% in 2021 (p < 10-3); conversely, ketoprofen was not used in 2019, but was consumed by 57% of patients in 2021 (p < 10-3). A history of abdominal surgery (OR = 0.37 (0.16-0.78, p = 0.011) and having surgery in 2020 rather than in 2019 (OR = 0.10 (0.04-0.24, p < 10<sup>-3</sup>)) and in 2021 than in 2019 (OR = 0.08 (0.03-0.20, p < 10<sup>-3</sup>)) were the only variables independently associated with the risk of opioid use. We found that neither clinical characteristics nor intraoperative findings had an impact on opioid consumption in this setting, and that it was possible to rapidly modify in-hospital analgesic consumption modalities by significantly reducing opioid consumption in favor of NSAIDS or nefopam.",22-08-2023,17-08-2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2023/
2023,Treatment of fever and associated symptoms in the emergency department: which drug to choose?,"Fever is a frequent cause of admission to the Emergency Department (ED) worldwide.

2023,An Unusual IgE-Mediated Hypersensitivity: Two Case Reports of Paracetamol Allergy.,"Paracetamol is one of the most commonly used analgesic and antipyretic agents worldwide, attributed in part to its excellent safety profile when administered at recommended doses. Paracetamol allergy is not common, and the majority of the reactions are related to the pharmacological action of cyclooxygenase 1 inhibition. Selective and Immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated hypersensitivity reactions are rare. In this article, the authors report two cases of paracetamol allergy in which the mechanism of IgE-mediated hypersensitivity was demonstrated by positive skin tests and basophil activation tests. We highlight the relevance of identifying the mechanism underlying the reaction since patients with IgE-mediated paracetamol allergies will be able to tolerate non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.",01-07-2023,17-08-2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2023/

2023,"Effect of single versus multiple prophylactic antibiotic doses on prosthetic joint infections following primary total hip arthroplasty in patients with osteoarthritis at public and private hospitals in Denmark: protocol for a nationwide cross-over, cluster randomised, non-inferiority trial [The Pro-Hip-Quality Trial].","A feared complication after total hip arthroplasty (THA) is prosthetic joint infection (PJI), associated with high morbidity and mortality. Prophylactic antibiotics can reduce the risk of PJI. However, there is no consensus on the dosages and current recommendations are based on a low evidence level. The objective is to compare the effect of a single versus multiple doses of prophylactic antibiotics administered within 24 hours on PJI.",21-08-2023,17-08-2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2023/
2023,"Graphene/metal-organic framework nano-sandwiches derived N, P-codoped porous carbon nanosheets as robust material for electrochemical analysis.","Construction of novel two-dimensional porous carbon nanosheets with superior electrochemical activity is of great challenge. Here, graphene/ZIF-8 nano-sandwiches derived N, P-codoped porous carbon nanosheets (N, P-codoped PCN) was easily obtained by sequential room temperature self-assembly and high-temperature carbonization method. Relative to the widely used physically exfoliated graphene nanosheets (GN) and graphene/ZIF-8 derived N-doped porous carbon nanosheets (N-doped PCN), N, P-codoped PCN displayed larger active surface, faster electron transport ability and stronger physical adsorption ability, which can be ascribed to the dual doping effect of heteroatoms N and P. As a result, N, P-codoped PCN exhibited remarkable oxidation signal enhancement for tumor marker (8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine), analgesic and antipyretic drug (acetaminophen) and organic pesticide (benomyl). Besides, the limits of detection were measured as low as 1.58 nM, 7.50 nM and 2.10 nM with sensitivity of 270.00 μA μM<sup>-1</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup>, 757.14 μA μM<sup>-1</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup> and 272.86 μA μM<sup>-1</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup> for 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, acetaminophen and benomyl, respectively. Basing on this, a novel and highly sensitive electrochemical sensing platform was developed. It is believed that the reported two-dimensional N, P-codoped PCN with unique structure and composition is highly valuable for the development of carbon-based electrochemical sensors.",09-10-2023,17-08-2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2023/
2023,"Discovery of hepatoprotective activity components from Thymus quinquecostatus celak. by molecular networking, biological evaluation and molecular dynamics studies.","Thymus quinquecostatus Celak. is an edible herb that widely cultivated in Asia and possesses hepatoprotective activity, but the underlying non-volatile components of this protective activity are not well studied. In this study, combining molecular networking visualization and bioassay-guided fractionation strategies, a pair of novel skeleton diterpenoid enantiomers, (+)- and (-)-thymutatusone A [(+)- and (-)-1], along with one new and one known biogenetically related compounds (2-3) and 16 other known compounds (4-19), were identified from T. quinquecostatus. Their structures were exhaustively characterized by comprehensive spectroscopic data, X-ray diffraction analysis, and ECD calculations. Compounds (±)-1, (-)-1, and (+)-1, with a rare tricyclo [7.3.1.0<sup>2,7</sup>] tridecane skeleton, exhibited potent hepatoprotective activity in HepG2 cells injured by acetaminophen, with EC<sub>50</sub> values of 11.5 ± 2.8, 8.4 ± 1.9, and 12.2 ± 0.3 μM respectively. They were more potent than positive drug bifendate (EC<sub>50</sub> 15.2 ± 1.3). Further, the underlying mechanism for the hepatoprotective activity of compound (-)-1 related to activating the Nrf 2 signaling pathway. What's more, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation analysis showed that compound (-)-1 could dock with the active site of Nrf 2 protein and form a stable system through hydrogen bonding. These results suggest that T. quinquecostatus can be used as a valuable source of hepatoprotective activity compounds.",16-08-2023,17-08-2023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2023/
